# FizzBuzz

A personal attempt at a standard interview question I found floating around on r/cscareerquestions.

I use a simple for loop to iterate between 1 and 100.
Within that for loop, I use the modulus command to fetch the remainders of 3 and 5 depending on the value of i [1-100]. If the remainder is 0, then we have a multiple
of either three or five and we print Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz as the instructions demand. Otherwise, we just print the value of i.
